# Toastmasters AI Companion

**Current Status:** Active Development (WIP)

This project is an exploration into AI-assisted software development.

## The Goal
As a remote Toastmaster, managing role-specific duties (like the **Ah-Counter** or **Grammarian**) usually involves juggling clunky spreadsheets while trying to pay attention to the speaker.

This project aims to kill the spreadsheet by building a streamlined, purpose-built web interface for tracking meeting metrics, "Word of the Day" usage, and filler words.

## The Stack
The core objectives of this project are the resulting app and the **workflow** used to build it.

* **Primary Tool:** [GitHub Spec Kit](https://githubnext.com/projects/spec-kit/)
* **Goal:** To go from "loose requirements" to "deployed prototype" with minimal friction.
* **Tech:** [TBD - likely React/Next.js/Tailwind]

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Spec & Structure
- [ ] Define the `spec.md` for the Grammarian and Ah-Counter roles.
- [ ] Scaffold the initial UI using AI generation tools.

### Phase 2: Core Features
- [ ] **Agenda Parsing:** Parse the meeting agenda and populate the meeting record structure.
- [ ] **Ah-Counter Interface:** simple click-tracking for filler words (Ah, Um, So, Like).
- [ ] **Grammarian Interface:** "Word of the Day" tracker and notable quotes logger.
- [ ] **Timer Interface:** Visual stopwatch with Green/Yellow/Red indicators.
- [ ] Report Generation: One-click summary to read at the end of the meeting.
